# Bean Engine Development TODO

## Project Overview
Bean Engine is a game development platform that bridges the gap between Scratch-style visual programming and professional game engines. The goal is to create an approachable yet powerful tool for learning game development.

**Target Timeline:** ~1 month for portfolio-ready proof of concept  
**Focus:** Demonstrable core features that showcase the engine's potential
