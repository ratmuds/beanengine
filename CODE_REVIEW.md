- Proper inheritance model with professional game engine patterns
- Comprehensive 3D transform system (BVector3, BQuaternion)
- Object hierarchy support with parent-child relationships
- World-space coordinate calculations

**Design Patterns:**
```typescript

    objects: BObject[];     // Flat list for easy iteration
    children: BObject[];    // Direct children only
}

class BObject {
    name: string;
    id: string;
    parent: BObject | null;
    children: BObject[];
}

class BNode3D extends BObject {
    position: BVector3;
    rotation: BQuaternion;  // Proper quaternion rotation
    scale: BVector3;
    positionOffset: BVector3;
    rotationOffset: BQuaternion;
}
```

**Advanced 3D Features:**
```typescript
// World position calculation with parent transforms
getWorldPosition(): BVector3 {
    if (!this.parent || !(this.parent instanceof BNode3D)) {
        return new BVector3(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.position.z);
    }
    const parentWorldPos = this.parent.getWorldPosition();
    return new BVector3(
        parentWorldPos.x + this.position.x,
        parentWorldPos.y + this.position.y,
        parentWorldPos.z + this.position.z
    );
}
```

```typescript
function createSceneStore() {
    const manager = new SceneManager();
    const { subscribe, update } = writable(manager);
    
    return {
        subscribe,
        createPartInFrontOfCamera: () => update(currentManager => {
            currentManager.createPartInFrontOfCamera();
            return currentManager; // Triggers reactivity
        }),
        addObject: (object) => update(currentManager => {
            currentManager.addObject(object);
            return currentManager;
        }),
        // ... other reactive methods
